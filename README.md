AgriTrace DAO – Trust in Food Supply

AgriTrace DAO is a blockchain-powered agri-traceability platform built on Algorand, ensuring transparency, trust, and fairness across the food supply chain — from farm to fork.

Farmers can register their crops, generate QR codes for each batch, and record every stage of the product’s journey on-chain.
Consumers can scan the QR to verify the origin, harvest details, and sustainability score of the food they buy.

The platform also includes a DAO Governance Portal, allowing farmers to propose and vote on policies like fair pricing and rewards — promoting community-driven decision-making.
